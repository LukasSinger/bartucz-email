# Mr. Bartucz Email Service
Allows you to send emails to Mr. Bartucz, completely free of charge (and warranty...)

## How to host it
1. Clone the repo to your server.
2. Install node.js, the `dotenv` package, and the `nodemailer` package.
3. Set the environment variables: `USERNAME` is for the sending address, `PASSWORD` is for the password for the sending address's account, and `BARTUCZ` is for Mr. Bartucz's email address.
4. Open a terminal in the repo's directory and run `node main.js`.
